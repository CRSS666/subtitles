# CRSS Subtitles

This repository contains subtitles for all CRSS Videos after QNN #1.
They can be edited directly in the github website, through [vscode web](https://github.dev/crss666/subtitles),
or, prefferably, using [Aegisub](https://aegisub.org/).

## File structure

Subtitles are stored in a folder with the title of the video they're from.

```txt
ðŸ“‚ qnn6
 \- en_us.ass
 \- pt_br.ass
ðŸ“‚ roptour2025
 \- en_us.ass
 \- pt_br.ass
```

Contributions with new translations should use their [respective language code](https://www.fincher.org/Utilities/CountryLanguageList.shtml),
two-letter, lowercase. (ex: `pt_br.ass`)

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute with new translations at any time. If you don't have push access to the repo,
[fork `crss666/subtitles`](https://github.com/CRSS666/subtitles/fork) and create a Pull Request with
your translation. If possible, @ blryface on [the CRSS discord]() so they publish it right away.
